      <p>Are you a Nepali student arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and heading to the University of Toledo? We understand that navigating a new city, especially after a long flight, can be overwhelming. That's why we've created this platform to connect you with reliable transportation. Our service offers convenient and affordable airport pickups provided by fellow Nepali community members. While we cannot guarantee a pickup for every student due to high demand, we strive to accommodate as many as possible. By utilizing this platform, not only do you ensure a smooth arrival, but you also contribute to supporting the Nepali student community at the University of Toledo. A portion of each fare goes towards funding future events and initiatives organized by the Nepali Student Organization.</p>
